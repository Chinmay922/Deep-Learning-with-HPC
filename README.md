# Task
Training a Pytorch Deep learning model on a Jupyter Notebook with a High Performance Computer and GPU.

# steps

## Create a Conda virtual environment in the terminal

* module add anaconda3/5.1.0
A conda virtual environment allows you to run/install a version of Python and package as needed within it.
This environment, once created/modified is saved and can be accessed later through the code:

* source activate NAME_OF_ENV # (Activate Environment)
* source deactivate NAME_OF_ENV # (Deactivate Environment)
